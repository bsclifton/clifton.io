My goal is to make a difference in people's lives.

I've been writing code since 1993 and I want to share all the things I've learned along the way.

I'm always learning new things, <a title="My GitHub profile" href="{{links.github}}" rel="me nofollow noopener" target="_blank">contributing on GitHub</a>,
