  My goal is to make a difference in people's lives.

  I've been writing code since 1993 and I want to share all the things I've learned along the way.

  I'm always learning new things, <a title="My GitHub profile" href="https://github.com/{{site.github_username}}" rel="me nofollow noopener" target="_blank">contributing on GitHub</a>,
  <a title="My Twitter account" href="https://www.twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}}" rel="me nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tweeting about coding</a>,
  and <a title="My blog" href="{{site.blog}}">blogging</a>.
