I joined **Brave** in 2016 where I work on the [Brave web browser](https://brave.com).
As the VP of Engineering, I get to manage development on the Desktop, Android, and iOS versions of the product.
It's been amazing seeing our company and product grow!

  Before **Brave**, I spent 8 years as a developer at **GoDaddy** working on different hosting products (2008 - 2016). These included dedicated hosting, VPS (virtual private server), shared hosting, and their associated UIs.

  Before **GoDaddy**, I was in the manufacturing (TMG) organization at **Intel** (2005 – 2008). I worked on middleware products (COM/DCOM, guaranteed delivery services, etc) used at the D1D factory in Hillsboro, Oregon. D1D is/was the flagship factory where the ground-breaking process engineering took place for processors. Products I worked on were used in the 1264 (65nm), 1266 (45nm) and 1268 (32nm) processes.

  Before **Intel** and **GoDaddy**, I also worked for several small businesses in the payment processing industry.

Some friends and I formed **Morgopolis Studios, LLC** in 2012 and released our first video game, [Magicians &amp; Looters](http://mal-game.com/), for the Xbox 360 Indie Games marketplace. It’s also available [for PC on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/284180/Magicians__Looters/).

I’ve been writing software since the early 1990s (when I was 10 or 11 years old) and I still love it. I attended and got a bachelor's degree from **UAT** (University of Advancing Technology) here in the valley (Tempe, Arizona, USA).
