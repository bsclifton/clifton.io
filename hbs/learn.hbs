        <h1>Learn Programming</h1>
        <p>
          <strong><em>This page is a work in progress- please understand that it's not done yet and contact me if you have ideas on what can be better</em></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I love programming and want to share it with as many people as possible. When I was a kid, I had no idea what I wanted to do "when I grow up".
          Writing code was something that started off as a hobby and ended up being what I got into professionally.
        </p>

        <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>
        <p>
          It's never too early (or too late) to get into programming. Writing code isn't "for nerds"- it's something anybody can learn to do.
        </p>

        <h3>Have fun and meet great people</h3>
        <p>
          Going in to work each day at my current job is rewarding and I truly enjoy the time I spend with my co-workers. We work hard and take care of business, but we have a good time while we do it.
          Companies will regularly reward employees with team building experiences where you get to enjoy a half day of work, a top notch lunch at a steakhouse or somewhere else fancy, and then an
          activity together.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my favorite things about working with really smart people is that you always will be learning new things. Learning doesn't stop in school- it's a life long process. I know I'm pretty good
          at what I do, but I regularly meet people who are better than me in different areas and this is a great chance for me to learn. I've learned a lot about technologies I haven't used before and
          gotten mentoring from people that are industry experts. I've also been lucky enough to share what I know and see people grow and become better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes just learning the technology isn't enough. I've learned about different cultures and languages. I've gotten to see things from other people's perspective, which helps me start to
          understand how and why people feel a certain way. I've learned how to listen to people and understand their concerns, how to become a great team member, and also how to confront someone
          constructively when an issue does come up.
        </p>

        <h3>Great pay and benefits</h3>
        <p>
          Besides having a good time, being a software engineer has great pay and benefits. You'll easily have enough money to get a nice car and a house.
          Having medical insurance is one that is super important. As you get older, you'll eventually get sick and if you don't have insurance, you'll get stuck with a pile of bills that can ruin your life.
        </p>
        <h4>My experience: Sharing the first 10 years of my reported income</h4>
        <p>
          This is info that people usually won't share; talking about pay can be taboo. However, I think it's extremely important to share a real world example for folks curious about the industry.
          When you view the table below, please remember that I graduated from college in May 2003 and got my first job in September 2003.

        <h3>Flexible schedule, no physical work required</h3>
        <p>
          This can be a huge one, especially if you have any health conditions.
          99% of the time, you'll be sitting down in a chair when you work. Since there is great collaboration software available (Skype, etc), working remotely or even at home is something people do.
          When you work in this field, unless you're doing consulting, you aren't working for an hourly wage. If you need to take a doctor appointment, no big deal- take care of that and make it up later.
          The most important thing is getting the job done, not the number of hours that takes.
        </p>
        <h4>My experience: What sold me about no physical work</h4>
        <p>
          When I was in highschool, I worked during the summer at my dad's plastics factory. It was pretty demanding;
          I'd be on my feet all day, working until I'm completely physically drained. I'd be bagging thousands of pounds of plastic pellets into 50 pound bags,
          stacking them up nice and neat on a pallet (used for shipping them). After we finished a run of plastic, I'd have to jump into the hoppers
          used to dry the material and clean them really well. The worst thing I remember was getting fiberglass stuck under my skin.
          The fiberglass is used in the Nylon 6/66 plastics to increase the strength and other properties.
          I could gently use one hand and go over my other arm and it would make a scratching noise, because my arms are full of small, almost invisible, pieces of fiberglass. It would take days for the pieces to work themselves out.
          I'd also work with chemicals used for coloring ABS plastic. If I wasn't careful and spilled the chemicals on myself, they were so strong that my skin would be stained for several days.
          I was doing all of this for $8 - 12 / hour back in 1998, 1999, and 2000. This works out to be roughly $16k - $25k a year.
        </p>
        <img src="/i/learn-factory.png" alt="Me in my teenage years; a factory worker in Tennessee"></img>
        <p>
          Even though I was in good physical shape and was able to do the job (once I got settled in), it was still physically demanding.
          What's even scarier was that I worked with a few folks that were in their mid or late 50's. These people were doing the same physical job that I (a teenager)
          was doing. Would I be able to do this same job, 40 years from now? What happens if you break your leg and weren't able to do the job for a while, would you get fired?
          Even if you're in great shape now, it's going to be really hard to do manual labor for your entire life.
        </p>

        <h3>Solve problems that matter to you</h3>
        <p>
          You have a chance to make a difference in the world. People rely on technologies and services like email, Skype, and Facebook to keep in touch with their friends and family.
          Software is an important part of how people do business in this day and age- whether it's accounting software like Turbotax.
          You have a chance to not only make a difference and have a positive impact to a large number of people's lives, but you also have an opportunity to be the
          one coming up with the new ideas and technologies that will take our society to the next level.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can always start your own company too-
          Once you have a solid idea, you can put together a business plan and look at securing funding. When you start and own your own company, you can decide what hours you work,
          what your employees work on, and focusing on making a big difference in the world.
          Who knows? Maybe I'll be reading about you in Forbes Magazine, with you being alongside Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates.
        </p>

        <h2 id="why">How do I get started?</h2>
        <h3>Start off with web development</h3>
        <p>
          Web development is a great way to start because it's <strong>really easy</strong> to get started. Any computer you use is going to have a web browser (Safari, Chrome, Edge/IE, Firefox, etc).
          To get started, you just open a text editor and start typing. Here's the bare-bones skeleton for any web page.
<pre>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Page title goes here&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    Content goes here
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>
        </p>

        <h4>Make your pages</h4>
        <p>
          If you get stuck, the great thing you can do? Right click > View Source. You can view the source for any web page to get ideas.
        </p>

        <h4>Get hosting - share your site!</h4>
        <p>
          Hosting is where your web pages will be stored. Basically, it's just someone else's computer which has internet access.
        </p>

        <h4>Domain name</h4>
        <p>
          Having a domain name gives folks an easy way to remember your website.
        </p>

        <h3>Become an open source enthusiast</h3>
        <h4>Sign up on GitHub</h4>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> is a great place to store code for your personal projects. Anyone can see it on the internet, which means you download it from anywhere and you can share the code with friends (Twitter, etc).
          Since it is publicly available, someone might discover your project and start submit a patch with changes.
        </p>

        <h4>My experience: Helping someone with a game</h4>
        <img src="/i/learn-dw.png" alt="A screenshot of the game, Dragon Warrior"></img>
        <p>
          Here's an example- <a href="https://github.com/Threllous/DragonWarriorJS">DragonWarriorJS</a>. This is an old Nintendo game I really enjoyed as a kid and this person was re-making it in the web browser.
          I found this project on GitHub and just started contributing. I was able to add a lot to the game and I submitted my changes to the original author for Christmas in 2014 (which took him by surprise!).
          <a href="https://dw.clifton.io/" target="_blank">Here's a link to the game</a> if you wanted to check it out.

        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Learn about business</h4>
        <p>
          Once you get started and have a grasp of programming, it opens all kinds of doors. Learning business skills can enable you to start your own business,
          become a successful program manager or product owner, or a salesperson.
